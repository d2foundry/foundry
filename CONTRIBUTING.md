# Contributing to Foundry's Monorepo

First, thank you for being interested in contributing to Foundry! We aim to make it possible for anyone that wants to help contribute to this project, including code free solutions such as feedback and questions.

## Have a Question, Feedback, or Idea? 

Our discord server is a perfect place to ask questions or to provide us feedback! You can join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/dzW2DZBBQH) and search for your question in the support thread. If you do not see your question asked, please feel free to open a new thread and we will address it when possible. If you have any feedback or ideas, the text channel ideas-and-feedback is the home for that.

### Opening an Issue

Before you open issue, please look in our discord support thread and see if your issue has been addressed there. If your issue has not been addressed, please feel free to open a thread there, and if comfortable doing so, in GitHub on our [repo](https://github.com/d2foundry/foundry/issues/new) as well.

### Writing Good Issues / Support Threads

Keep issues to a single problem or request. Do not put multiple bugs, problems, requests into the same issue. The more information you can provide, the more likely it is that we can address it faster and more accurately. Also, if the issue is able to be reproduced, please list out the exact steps taken to cause the issue to happen.

When creating a new issue please give a descriptive name in its title so that we can discern your issue from a possible similar issue. Along with the name, please apply a prefix to it that aligns with what app, package, or the monorepo itself your issue relates to. This way we can better track what part of the repo your issue pertains to.

Examples of what these prefixes can be are:

* apps/docs
* packages/ui
* monorepo

Example of good information for an issue's description:

* Browser used
* Extensions installed
* Steps to reproduce the issue
* What did you expect to see versus what you see
* Screenshots / gifs
* Dev console output 

Lastly, please apply the appropriate github tags that fit the issue's scope.

## Want to Contribute Via Code?

Please fork the [d2foundry/foundry](https://github.com/d2foundry/foundry) repo and create a branch from there to hold your changes. Once you have finalized your changes, push to your remote, open an issue and pull request on our repo, and link your pr to the issue.

### Code Checklist

* [ ] follow the readme of the app/package you are working on to get started
* [ ] make sure your code is formatted via prettier
* [ ] use our [commit tags](#commit-tags) to format your commit message

#### Commit Tags

* chore - general maintenance
* bungie - addresses a change due to new changes from bungie
* fix - fixes a bug
* add - new pages, functionality, etc
* data - we had wrong data
* feat - usually bigger, whole releases or functionality
