## Starting a Compare session

### Adding a weapon roll to Compare

You can start a Compare session by pressing the "+ Compare" button located at the top of the Weapon page.

All selected perks and effect levels will be added to that weapon roll. You can safely navigate to other weapon pages, reload the page, or come back at a later time and your session will persist.

### Adding additional rolls

If you would like to add additional rolls of the same weapon, you can make your selections and press the same "+ Compare" button. Duplicate roll selections will be prevented from being added by greying out the button and showing it has already been added.

## Viewing the Compare screen

To view the Compare screen, you can click the floating "Compare" indicator at the bottom of your screen. You can also manually visit the [Compare page](https://d2foundry.gg/compare) by going to the URL directly, or by clicking back using your browser if it was the last page visited.

### Getting back to a weapon page

To get back to a selected roll's weapon page, you can click the card at the top of the Compare table that contains the weapon's name, icon, and perks. This will take you back to that weapon and preserve your selections for that roll.

### Reordering Compare rolls

The Compare table will show whichever roll was selected first to the left, with rolls that were added after to the right. It shows the positive/negative deltas for those subsequent rolls compared to that first item.

If you would like to move a roll to be in that first slot to see how other rolls compare, locate the arrow icon at the top of the roll's column in the Compare table.

## Removing rolls from Compare

To remove a roll from Compare, you can select the X icon located at the top of the roll's column in the Compare table.

To remove all items from Compare, you can select the "Clear all" button at the top of the Compare screen.
